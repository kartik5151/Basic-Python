# This program will add two numbers with user input

x = input('Enter First Number')
y = input('Enter Second Number')

# int(x) and int(y) defines that input number should be integer
sum = int(x) + int(y)
# we can write  data types according to our needs

print("The sum is", sum)


# Same program can be use for different data types - float and complex
